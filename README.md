A repository to store the code and parameter sets associated with this paper.

The following XPP code was used to analyze the system ODEs and generate figures:

1) IC_BVP_ac.ode is used to find the peak ICU cases over varied parameters (right panels of Figs 4 and 5 in the paper)
2) Rt_BVP_ac.ode is used to track the time to Rt=1 across parameters (left panels of Figs 4 and 5)
3) model_Vax_ac.ode is used to run simulations (produced data shown in Fig 2)

The parameter sets used in this study can be found in the ParameterSets/ folder.
